        === NESTED IF STATEMENTS IN C ===

        ðŸ”¹ A nested `if` means using one `if` (or if-else) inside another.
        ðŸ”¹ Useful when decisions depend on multiple levels of conditions.
        ðŸ”¹ Each inner `if` is executed **only if** the outer `if`'s condition is true.
        ðŸ”¹ Nested `if`s can be inside both `if` and `else` blocks.

    /*
        === NOTES / KEY RULES FOR NESTED IF ===

        âœ” You can nest any number of `if` or `if-else` statements.
        âœ” Maintain indentation for clarity â€” otherwise logic becomes confusing.
        âœ” Use `else if` if there are mutually exclusive conditions at the same level.
        âœ” Always use curly braces `{}` in nested blocks even for single statements â€” helps avoid bugs.
        
        ðŸ§  For example:
        if (a) 
            if (b)
                do_something();
        // Without braces, it's not clear if outer or inner 'if' controls the body

        âœ” Nested ifs are NOT loops. They execute once if condition is true â€” no repetition.

        âœ” Example use-cases of nested if:
            - Login system: check if user exists, then check password
            - E-commerce: check if user is logged in, then check stock availability
            - Admission: check eligibility, then check document submission
